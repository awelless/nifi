# ConsumeKinesis

## Record processing

When _Record Reader_ and _Record Writer_ properties are set, _ConsumeKinesis_ operates in Record mode.
In this mode, the processor reads records from Kinesis streams using the configured _Record Reader_,
and writes them to FlowFiles using the configured _Record Writer_.

The processor tries to optimize the number of FlowFiles created by batching multiple records with the same schema
into a single FlowFile.

### Schema changes

_ConsumeKinesis_ supports dynamically changing Kinesis record schemas. When a record with new schema is encountered,
the currently open FlowFile is closed and a new FlowFile is created for the new schema. Thanks to this, the processor
preserves record ordering for a single Shard, even with record schema changes.

**Please note**, the processor relies on _Record Reader_ to provide correct schema for each record.
Using a Reader with schema inference may produce a lot of different schemas, which may lead to excessive FlowFile creation.
If performance is a concern, it is recommended to use a Reader with a predefined schema or schema registry.

### Output Strategies

This processor offers multiple strategies configured via processor property _Output Strategy_ for converting Kinesis records into FlowFiles.

- _Use Content as Value_ (the default) writes only a Kinesis record value to a FlowFile.
- _Use Wrapper_ writes a Kinesis Record value as well as metadata into separate fields of a FlowFile record.
- _Inject Metadata_ writes a Kinesis Record value to a FlowFile record and adds a sub-record to it with metadata.

The written metadata includes the following fields:
- _stream_: The name of the Kinesis stream the record was received from.
- _shardId_: The identifier of the shard the record was received from.
- _sequenceNumber_: The sequence number of the record.
- _subSequenceNumber_: The subsequence number of the record, used when multiple smaller records are aggregated into a single Kinesis record. If a record was not part of a batch, this value will be 0.
- _shardedSequenceNumber_: A combination of the sequence number and subsequence number. This can be used to uniquely identify a record within a shard.
- _partitionKey_: The partition key of the record.
- _approximateArrival_: The approximate arrival timestamp of the record (in milliseconds since epoch).

The record schema that is used when _Use Wrapper_ is selected is as follows (in Avro format):

```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "nifiRecord",
  "namespace": "org.apache.nifi",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "value",
      "type": [
        {
          < Fields as determined by the Record Reader for a Kinesis message >
        },
        "null"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "kinesisMetadata",
      "type": [
        {
          "type": "record",
          "name": "metadataType",
          "fields": [
            { "name": "stream", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "shardId", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "sequenceNumber", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "subSequenceNumber", "type": ["long", "null"] },
            { "name": "shardedSequenceNumber", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "partitionKey", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "approximateArrival", "type": [ { "type": "long", "logicalType": "timestamp-millis" }, "null" ] }
          ]
        },
        "null"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The record schema that is used when "Inject Metadata" is selected is as follows (in Avro format):

```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "nifiRecord",
  "namespace": "org.apache.nifi",
  "fields": [
    < Fields as determined by the Record Reader for a Kinesis message >,
    {
      "name": "kinesisMetadata",
      "type": [
        {
          "type": "record",
          "name": "metadataType",
          "fields": [
            { "name": "stream", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "shardId", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "sequenceNumber", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "subSequenceNumber", "type": ["long", "null"] },
            { "name": "shardedSequenceNumber", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "partitionKey", "type": ["string", "null"] },
            { "name": "approximateArrival", "type": [ { "type": "long", "logicalType": "timestamp-millis" }, "null" ] }
          ]
        },
        "null"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Here is an example of FlowFile content that is emitted by JsonRecordSetWriter when strategy _Use Wrapper_ is selected:

```json
[
  {
    "value": {
      "address": "1234 First Street",
      "zip": "12345",
      "account": {
        "name": "Acme",
        "number": "AC1234"
      }
    },
    "kinesisMetadata" : {
      "stream" : "stream-name",
      "shardId" : "shardId-000000000000",
      "sequenceNumber" : "123456789",
      "subSequenceNumber" : 3,
      "shardedSequenceNumber" : "12345678900000000000000000003",
      "partitionKey" : "123",
      "approximateArrival" : 1756459596788
    }
  }
]
```

Here is an example of FlowFile content that is emitted by JsonRecordSetWriter when strategy _Inject Metadata_ is selected:

```json
[
  {
    "address": "1234 First Street",
    "zip": "12345",
    "account": {
      "name": "Acme",
      "number": "AC1234"
    },
    "kinesisMetadata" : {
      "stream" : "stream-name",
      "shardId" : "shardId-000000000000",
      "sequenceNumber" : "123456789",
      "subSequenceNumber" : 3,
      "shardedSequenceNumber" : "12345678900000000000000000003",
      "partitionKey" : "123",
      "approximateArrival" : 1756459596788
    }
  }
